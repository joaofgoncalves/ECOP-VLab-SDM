# IRIS-SDM model/service

| Description | IRIS-SDM stands for "Infrastructure for Running, Inspecting and Summarizing Species Distribution Models". This modelling service aims to predict the spatial distribution of suitable habitat conditions for narrowly distributed species (tested here with Iris boissieri) based on satellite-derived Ecosystem Functional Attributes. It implements a ‘generic’ version of the R-biomod2 correlative ensemble Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) framework (Thuiller et al. 2009, Thuiller et al. 2014). The service currently runs a demo based on the approach described in Arenas-Castro et al. (2018) for modelling the distribution of Iris boissieri (‘Geres lily’) for the northwest part of the Iberian Peninsula (which includes the species’ full range). It is based on pre-existing in-field records for the species presence as well as on a set of predictors from satellite-derived Ecosystem Functioning Attributes (EFA), namely the annual dynamics (average for the period 2001-2016) of three components related to carbon gains (EVI), sensible heat (LST) and radiative balance (albedo). The service aims at generality so that any species can be modelled against EFA predictors, using the IRIS-SDM service based on its R code structures and the biomod2 package designed for multi-algorithm ensemble forecasting. | Input Data and Format | IRIS-SDM requires three inputs for running the model: i) a csv file named input_records.csv containing presence-only records for the target species. The two first columns of this file contain the X and Y coordinates in the same coordinate reference system of the input raster predictor variables; ii) a csv file named parameters.csv containing a set of (hyper)parameter values for running the R biomod2 package ensemble modelling approach; iii) a zip file named vars.zip containing a set of GeoTIFF raster files used as predictor variables and therefore with a known linkage to the target species' distribution and habitat suitability. For running the example, EO-based variables related to the species habitat features were used. These data must have the same coordinate reference system of the input presence records. | ECOPOTENTIAL products used | Currently, the service uses several ECOPOTENTIAL products related to satellite-derived Ecosystem Functioning Attributes, namely the annual dynamics (average for the period 2001-2016) of three components linked to carbon gains (EVI), sensible heat (LST) and radiative balance (albedo) computed in the Google Earth Engine platform by project partners. | Output Data and Format | Outputs include the following files: (i) an output log file (plain txt) and, (ii) the main output archive (zip file) containing model-based, spatially-explicit predictions for the current distribution of the target species in raster GeoTIFF format. This also includes tables (in .csv format) with a summary of model performances for partial and ensemble models as well as an importance ranking for each predictor variable. | For more info about this service check the source code and the README page at GitHub  https://github.com/joaofgoncalves/ECOP-VLab-SDM
